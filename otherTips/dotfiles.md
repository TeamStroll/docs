## Dotfiles

Dotfiles can help improve and speed up your coding performance by removing a lot of the additional typing you have to do (also shorter commands are easier to remember).

Your bash profile (or zsh profile) should live at an address approximately like this:
`~/.bash_profile` (this is what it will be on Mac if you are using bash and haven't changed anything). In Linux it should be at `~/.bashsrc` or `~/.zhshrc`.

Open this in your IDE/editor of choice and go wild. But remember:
