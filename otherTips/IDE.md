# IDEs

## Some good IDEs

- [Atom](https://atom.io/)
  - It's free, uses React (it's a chromium shell), has nice plugins and snippets
  - Supports some nice things (it can natively read .jars, unlike sublime)
- [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
  - Programmed in C++ and Python, so it is faster
